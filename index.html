<p>The special treatment afforded to the stars has drawn criticism and ire from stranded Australians. There is particular consternation because Australia's government recently cut the weekly number of citizens allowed to return. An Aussie in London told the BBC: "I can't comprehend the fact that one week they announce they're halving the caps for citizens and the following week they announce they've found 1,200 spaces for tennis players and support staff." A Twitter user wrote: "Letting in 1,200 tennis players and their entourage...is a risky choice, and what hurts is that they'd take that risk for sport but not for stranded Aussies." He said: "The government can no longer claim it's just about the science".</p>
