<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/"target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Christmas cake</a> is a <strong>centuries-<u>old</u> tradition</strong>. The majority of people who enjoy this festive treat may not know the science behind slicing it. A professor of mathematics and geometry tested the best way to cut a Christmas cake into slices. He focused on cutting it while leaving the insides as moist as possible. He said it is best to cut across the middle into two semicircles, then cut slices and push the remaining halves together. <p>hello l want to go abroad someday.</p>
